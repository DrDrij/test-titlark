# Show Effects of IES On Consumption Function

The notebook [PerfForesightCRRA-Impatience-Problems](https://econ-ark.org/_materials/PerfForesightCRRA-Impatience-Problems) asks you to explore the relationship between various impatience factors and the consumption function.

In your Virtual Machine, your assignment is:

1. Change to the `GitHub/econ-ark` directory
1. `git clone https://github.com/econ-ark/TITLARK` to get the teaching tools repo
1. `cd TITLARK/notebooks`
1. Make a copy of the notebook to put your solutions in:
   * `cp PerfForesightCRRA-Impatience-Problems.ipynb PerfForesightCRRA-Impatience-Problems-And-Solutions.ipynb`
1. Launch a `jupyter notebook` and read through the notebook
1. After any code cell containing `# PROBLEM`:
   * You should create a code cell that begins with the text `# SOLUTION` 
   * These should contain your code for answering the corresponding question
   
Given the short notice, I don't expect everyone to finish the assignment by the time class starts. But I would like everyone to get as far as they can, at least to the point of having cloned the `TITLARK` repo
